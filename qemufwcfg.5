.Sh NAME
.Nm qemufqcfg
.Nd "QEMU Firmware Config client interface"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Pp
To load as a loadable kernel module:
.Pp
.Dl "kldload fusefs"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver implements the client driver for QEMU's firmware configuration interface.
.Pp
This interface allows QEMU, or a compatible emulator or hypervisor such as
.Xr bhyve 8 ,
to provide configuration files via a simple interface.
The core interface is a simple (read-only) key-value store that uses 16-bit integers as keys and bytes streams as values.
.Pp
This driver is intended to be used in conjunction with a single userspace client, such as the 
.Xr mount_qemufwcfg 8
FUSE filesystem.
.Pp
The driver supports a single command via the 
.Xr ioctl 2
system call:
.Dv FWCFGIO_SET_INDEX .
This takes a 16-bit integer as the argument and selects the specified entry in the host.
Subsequent
.Xr read 2
calls will read the byte stream associated with that selector.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm qemufqcfg
driver first appeared in NetBSD 9.0.
The
.Fx
implementation, which used the NetBSD version as a reference, first appeared in 
.Fx 14.0
.

The
.Nm qemufqcfg
driver was originally written by
